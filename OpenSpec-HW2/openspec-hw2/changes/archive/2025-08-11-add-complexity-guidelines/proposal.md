# Add Complexity Management Guidelines

## Why
OpenSpec-HW2 currently lacks guidance on managing complexity, leading to over-engineered solutions when simple ones suffice.

## What Changes
- Add "Start Simple" section to openspec-hw2/README.md with default minimalism rules
- Add complexity triggers to help identify when complexity is justified
- Enhance AI assistant instructions in CLAUDE.md to bias toward simplicity

## Impact
- Affected specs: None (documentation only)
- Affected code: openspec-hw2/README.md, CLAUDE.md
